Hi everyone! Welcome to The Queen Vee Club! 

So, let me start by saying that Steven Mitchell is an absolute legend. His playing for ballet classes in nearly every single professional class in New York City is legendary to begin with - and that would be only scratching the surface of his endless talent. Steven Mitchell has recorded MANY albums to accompany ballet classes - children's, adults' and professionals'. You'd be pressed to find a ballet instructor in the United States who's never used one of his albums for their class. Many of those albums were recorded in collaboration with the equally legendary, late David Howard. 

Mr. Mitchell could also be found as Music Rehearsal Director at the Metropolitan Opera House for the better part of a decade. This meant that likely every production you went to see at The Met had Steven Mitchell's input. I'm telling you, the man is a LEGEND! 

On his spare time, he writes and rehearses comedic Off-Off-Broadway productions. One of them is the darling musical "Date Me, Do Me, Dump Me". DMDMDM is a show centered around four female characters who have had their share of, er, let's call them "dating difficulties". They laugh about it, drink over it, sing together in unison as they each tell horror tales of dates' past. The audience is invited to participate by sharing its own dating woes. Everyone has fun! Audiences in New York were delighted and loads of people enjoyed themselves in the summer of 2019, when the show ran at the Broadway Comedy Club all summer long! 

If you weren't there, worry not! This is these divas' club, and you're definitely invited. :) Have FUN!
